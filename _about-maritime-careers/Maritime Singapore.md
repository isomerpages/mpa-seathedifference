### About Maritime Singapore
Singapore is both a global hub port and a leading international maritime centre. 

More than 200 shipping lines call at our port and we are connected to more than 600 ports worldwide. We have been awarded the Asian Freight Logistics and Supply Chain Awards, Best Global Seaport and Best Seaport in Asia.

Singapore is also home to more than 170 international shipping groups compromising, container, bulk carriers, tanker, offshore and LNG markets. Besides a high concentration of international shipping groups, Maritime Singapore also offers a comprehensive range of both technical and commercial maritime services such as finance, broking, insurance, surveying, legal and arbitration.
