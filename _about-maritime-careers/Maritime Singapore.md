### About Maritime Singapore
Singapore is both a global hub port and a leading international maritime centre. 

Singapore has been the busiest port in the world in terms of shipping tonnage since 1986. This year, we’ve been awarded the Best Global Seaport and Best Seaport in Asia at the 2023 Asian Freight Logistics and Supply Chain Awards. More than 200 shipping lines call at our port and we are connected to more than 600 ports worldwide. 

Singapore is also home to more than 170 international shipping groups compromising, container, bulk carriers, tanker, offshore and LNG markets. Besides a high concentration of international shipping groups, Maritime Singapore also offers a comprehensive range of both technical and commercial maritime services such as finance, broking, insurance, surveying, legal and arbitration. 

This year, Singapore has been recognised as the world’s top maritime centre in the Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Centre Development Index.
