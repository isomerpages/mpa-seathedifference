### Home to more than 170 international shipping groups
Today, Maritime Singapore is home to more than 170 international shipping groups, not only in the traditional container, bulk and tanker sectors but also in the offshore and LNG markets. Besides a high concentration of international shipping groups, Maritime Singapore offers a comprehensive range of both technical and commercial maritime services such as finance, broking, insurance, surveying, legal and arbitration. 

Located at the heart of the East-West trade routes along the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, Singapore is a natural gateway to many major growth economies as well as the world’s largest commodity consumers and producers.

Maritime Singapore offers excellent connectivity to access opportunities in the Asian and international markets. Maritime executives can tap on Singapore’s Changi International Airport more than 7,400 weekly flights to gain access to 400 cities in 100 countries to conduct business. 

Singapore has a stable governmental regime, transparent legal framework and strong rule of law. The nation has been ranked fifth globally and the only Asian country in the top ten in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2022. 

Maritime Singapore provides access to a pool of manpower and talent which companies can tap on. As the champion agency driving the growth of Maritime Singapore, MPA has introduced many initiatives to ensure that its workforce is well prepared to meet the maritime industry’s current and future needs. MPA, together with the industry and other key stakeholders, are mapping out ways to grow our Singaporean core, for example, by way of initiatives that help with skills deepening and mastery. As one of the most liveable city in Asia, Singapore is a safe and attractive city to work and live in.
