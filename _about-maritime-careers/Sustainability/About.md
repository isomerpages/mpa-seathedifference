<h2>Help Singapore achieve net-zero emissions by 2050</h2>
<p>Climate change is undoubtedly one of the most pressing issues of our&nbsp;generation.
We need to manage the limited resources on Mother Earth so that the needs
of our future generations can continue to be met. As one of the world’s
busiest ports, Singapore plays an important role in helping the global
maritime industry reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and accelerate the green
energy transition for International shipping.</p>
<h3>Why is sustainability important?</h3>
<p>Let’s hear from MPA&nbsp;Chief Sustainability Officer Er. Tham Wai Wah,
as well as staff involved in the Tuas Port project about how&nbsp;MaritimeSG&nbsp;is
tackling the threat of&nbsp;climate change, to create a greener and more&nbsp;sustainable
future for the&nbsp;maritime&nbsp;sector.</p>
