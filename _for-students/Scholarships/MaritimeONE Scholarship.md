MaritimeONE Scholarship
=======================

The&nbsp;[MaritimeONE Scholarship](https://brightsparks.com.sg/profile/smf/index.php)&nbsp;identifies and cultivates young maritime talent by preparing them for the industry.

The Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF) works closely with leading maritime organisations that sponsor the scholarships. The scholarship extends across a wide range of local and overseas diploma as well as degree courses. Beyond financial support, SMF matches MaritimeONE scholars to industry mentors through a structured mentorship programme that will guide young talent throughout their educational journey.
