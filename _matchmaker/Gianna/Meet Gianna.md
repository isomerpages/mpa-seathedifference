A disillusioned young business executive finds herself at a professional crossroad, ensnared in a cycle of stagnation that veils her path to self-fulfillment and ikigai.

Their conversation flutters around a forgotten book on ‘IKIGAI’, left behind on the cafe table. As the maritime world unfurls through Gloria's tales, Gianna finds herself voyaging through stories of individuals like Gladys See.
