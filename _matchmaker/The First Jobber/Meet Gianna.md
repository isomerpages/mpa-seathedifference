Meet Gladys See, a shipbroker at Howe Robinson Partners. Similar to Gianna's quest for fulfillment, Gladys also realized her initial career path wasn't her true calling, sparking her pursuit of a more aligned and exciting role in maritime. Initially working in the marketing department in the Food &amp; Beverage sector, her venture into the maritime sector is unexpected and anything but conventional. Her analytical and networking capabilities, along with her outgoing personality and can-do mind-set have put her in good stead in her maritime journey.
