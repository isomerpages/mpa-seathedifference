Meet Selvam, a jack-of-all-trades zipping through Singapore's streets on his food delivery bike. Each delivery adds a few notes to his daily tune, but the melody of his life feels repetitive, missing a chorus of stability. His diverse gigs paint his days with variety, but the canvas of his career longs for a steadier stroke.

One day, a quirky ad leads him to Gloria, a maritime veteran with a whimsy for the piano. Amid playful banter and melodies, she unveils a world where Selvam's love for creativity meets the structured harmony of maritime technology. Through tales of individuals who've tuned their careers to the maritime beat, Gloria strikes a chord of curiosity in Selvam.
